# Deno Actions

This repository holds a couple of useful GitHub Actions for working with Deno.
The actions are:

- CI (ci.yml): Run tests, format and linting checks on your Deno project
- Build Container (build-container.yml): Build a Docker container for your Deno project
- Coverage (coverage.yml): Generate a coverage report for your Deno project and uploads it onto Github Pages to [`https://<YourUsername>.github.io/<RepositoryName>/index.html`](https://<YourUsername>.github.io/<RepositoryName>/index.html).

You can find the workflows in the `.github/workflows` directory.
